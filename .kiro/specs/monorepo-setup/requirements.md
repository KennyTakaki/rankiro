# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will establish a comprehensive monorepo structure for developing TypeScript applications with AWS CDK infrastructure and web frontend components. The setup will provide a standardized development environment with modern tooling including Turborepo for task running, pnpm for package management, and comprehensive code quality tools. The monorepo will support multiple applications and shared packages while maintaining consistent development practices across the entire codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured monorepo with clear separation between applications and packages, so that I can efficiently develop and maintain both frontend applications and infrastructure code in a single repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the monorepo THEN the system SHALL create a workspace structure with apps/web, packages/rankiro, and packages/cdk-utils directories
2. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate frontend applications in the apps directory and shared packages in the packages directory
3. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use pnpm workspace functionality to handle inter-package dependencies
4. IF a new application or package is added THEN the system SHALL follow the established directory structure and naming conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code formatting and linting across the entire monorepo, so that all code maintains high quality standards and follows the same style guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL enforce consistent formatting using Prettier
2. WHEN committing code THEN the system SHALL run ESLint to catch potential issues and enforce coding standards
3. WHEN using modules THEN the system SHALL primarily use ESModules throughout the codebase
4. IF code quality checks fail THEN the system SHALL prevent commits until issues are resolved

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient task running and build processes, so that I can quickly build, test, and deploy applications across the monorepo without manual coordination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running build tasks THEN the system SHALL use Turborepo to coordinate and cache build processes across packages
2. WHEN executing tasks THEN the system SHALL respect package dependencies and run tasks in the correct order
3. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL leverage Turborepo's caching to avoid unnecessary rebuilds
4. IF a package changes THEN the system SHALL only rebuild affected packages and their dependents

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust package management with workspace support, so that I can efficiently manage dependencies and share code between packages without version conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing packages THEN the system SHALL use pnpm as the primary package manager
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL leverage pnpm's workspace functionality for efficient dependency resolution
3. WHEN sharing code between packages THEN the system SHALL use workspace references to maintain consistency
4. IF dependency conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL use pnpm's resolution strategies to resolve them automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing capabilities with TypeScript support, so that I can write and run tests for all packages and applications in the monorepo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN the system SHALL use Jest as the primary testing framework
2. WHEN testing TypeScript code THEN the system SHALL use ts-jest for seamless TypeScript integration
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support running tests for individual packages or the entire monorepo
4. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent deployment

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated security scanning and git hooks, so that sensitive information is prevented from being committed and code quality is maintained automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN committing code THEN the system SHALL run Gitleaks to scan for potential secret leakage
2. WHEN making commits THEN the system SHALL use Husky to enforce pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
3. WHEN secrets are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent the commit and provide guidance on remediation
4. IF pre-commit checks fail THEN the system SHALL block the commit until issues are resolved

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CI/CD pipeline integration, so that code changes are automatically tested, built, and deployed through GitHub Actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN the system SHALL trigger GitHub Actions workflows for testing and building
2. WHEN running CI/CD THEN the system SHALL execute tests, linting, and build processes for all affected packages
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use the monorepo structure to deploy only changed applications and their dependencies
4. IF CI/CD processes fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide detailed error information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working with AWS infrastructure, I want reusable CDK utilities and helper functions, so that I can consistently deploy resources across different environments with proper naming conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying AWS resources THEN the system SHALL use helper functions from packages/cdk-utils for consistent resource naming
2. WHEN reading configuration THEN the system SHALL use utilities that read environment variables and CDK context
3. WHEN deploying to different stages THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate naming conventions for each development stage
4. IF environment configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to sensible defaults
