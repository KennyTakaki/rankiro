## Requirements

4. IF the YouTube API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display cached data with a timestamp indicating when it was last updated

### Requirement 2

2. WHEN a user changes sorting preferences THEN the system SHALL update the video list within 2 seconds
3. WHEN sorting by popularity THEN the system SHALL prioritize videos with higher view counts and engagement
4. IF sorting data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL fall back to default popularity-based ranking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Kiro user, I want to see key information about each video, so that I can quickly identify which Kiro content is most relevant to my needs without having to watch every video.

2. WHEN displaying video information THEN the system SHALL show the channel name and a brief description
