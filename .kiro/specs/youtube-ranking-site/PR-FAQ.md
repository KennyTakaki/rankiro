## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: Why do we need another way to discover trending YouTube content when YouTube already has a trending page?

**A:** YouTube's trending page has several limitations that our platform addresses:

1. **Update frequency**: YouTube's trending page updates infrequently (often 12-24 hours), while our platform refreshes every 15 minutes

3. **Filtering options**: YouTube provides limited filtering capabilities, while we offer comprehensive category and regional filters
4. **Historical context**: We show how long videos have been trending, giving users better context about content momentum
