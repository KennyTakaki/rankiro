2. **Processing**: Real-time and batch processing of incoming data
3. **Storage**: Processed data stored in appropriate databases
4. **Analytics**: Aggregated data for reporting and insights
5. **Delivery**: Data served via APIs and web interface

### Database Design
```sql
-- Core entities
Videos (id, title, description, upload_date, creator_id)
Metrics (video_id, timestamp, views, likes, comments, shares)
Rankings (video_id, rank, score, category, timestamp)
Users (id, username, email, role, created_at)
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Redis**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- **CDN Caching**: Static asset caching with CloudFront
